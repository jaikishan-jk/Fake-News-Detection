# Fake-News-Detection

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning-based system for the detection of fake news articles. The project uses supervised learning techniques to classify news as either genuine or fake. Necessary libraries and modules are imported, such as pandas for data handling, NLTK for natural language processing, scikit-learn for machine learning, and numpy for numerical computations. After this we perform data preprocessing which includes loading the dataset handling missing values and feature engineering.After this stemming operation is done to remove non-alphabetic characters, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and stemming each word.Then the pre-processed textual data is converted to numerical data using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique.The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function. 20% data is set as test data andthe remaining as train data. i have used logistic regression to train the model. finally  The accuracy score is calculated to evaluate the performance of the model on both the training and test data and The predictions are made using the trained model to predict whether the news is real or fake.
